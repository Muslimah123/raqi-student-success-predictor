## Motivation
Education is a vital cornerstone of society, and understanding the factors that contribute to student success can lead to improved educational outcomes. The primary motivation behind this project is to create a predictive model that can forecast student success in Iraqi secondary schools, thereby enabling educators and policymakers to identify students at risk and implement targeted interventions.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains information collected from questionnaires administered in Iraqi secondary schools. It includes demographic attributes, economic indicators, educational background details, time-related features, and academic performance marks. A detailed description of the dataset's attributes can be found in Table 1.

## Methodology
Our approach involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, predictive modeling, and evaluation. We employ machine learning algorithms to build predictive models that forecast student success based on the provided features. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess model performance.
